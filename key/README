createKey.sh takes a parameter, which is the domain you will use.

For example, if you want to use "www.yongbak.com" as your website, create microCA and certificate with the command below:

./createKey.sh www.yongbak.com


The command above create several files.

The client(Browser) takes .crt file, and the server takes privkey and cert files.
